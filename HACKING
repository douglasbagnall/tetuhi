Te tuhi style guidelines

For python code, you should more or less follow the canonical style,
as described in PEP 8 [1]. Most operators have spaces around them,
four space indent, no tabs. Try to avoid trailing whitespace. Lines
can run a bit over 80 characters if it makes sense.  Aim for Python
2.4 compatibility.

The C code is similar to PEP 7's [2] Python 3000 convention, which
also means 4 spaces per indent and spaces around binary operators.
Unfortunately the code contains tabs, representing 8 spaces.  This is
what is generated by Emacs' C python style. The C dialect is
relatively gcc-ish and modern; C99 is good. If at some point somebody
wants to compile the code with something other than GCC, we can look
at it then.
