The files in this directory form a small neural network library
(libperceptron) that I have used in a few projects.  It contains
features not used by the wider Te Tuhi system.  

If there is demand, libperceptron could be separated out from the
tetuhi package, and additionally licensed as LGPL. That would require
the removal of the GSL dependency, as GSL is GPL only.

(removing the GSL dependency might be a good idea anyway, given that
it is only used for random numbers).
