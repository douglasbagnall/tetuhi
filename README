Binaries

In 0.85 I have included binary versions of the C extension modules,
compiled for the Geode and Python version 2.5.  This is for the
convenience of OLPC users, and anyone else who can't be bothered
trying to figure out how to build the modules.  These are in the
./binaries/olpc directory.

Compiling

It may be necessary to change the Makefiles compile the C code in the
perceptron, c, and img-c directories. Known issues are:

 * For x86-64 systems, the -fPIC flag must be used. As Eric Piel puts
   it:
      This implies not only changing the COMMON_OPTS variables, but
      also running "python setup.py build_ext" with "CFLAGS=-fPIC
      LDFLAGS=-fPIC"

 * PYTHON may need to be set to python-2.4, python-2.5 or whatever.
