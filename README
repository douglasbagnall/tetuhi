Compiling

It may be necessary to change the Makefiles compile the C code in the
perceptron, c, and img-c directories. Known issues are:

 * For x86-64 systems, the -fPIC flag must be used. As Eric Piel puts
   it:
      This implies not only changing the COMMON_OPTS variables, but
      also running "python setup.py build_ext" with "CFLAGS=-fPIC
      LDFLAGS=-fPIC"

 * PYTHON may need to be set to python-2.4, python-2.5 or whatever.
