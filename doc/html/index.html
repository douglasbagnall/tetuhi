    <h1>Te Tuhi Video Game System</h1>
      
      <p>Te Tuhi is a program for turning arbitrary still images into
      video games. It is licensed under the Gnu General Public License
      (GPL). The software was originally used in an art exhibition
      with custom hardware, but it should run on any ordinary computer.
      </p>

      <p>It was designed to work with crayon drawings on paper.</p>
